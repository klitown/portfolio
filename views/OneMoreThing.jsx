            Currently studying Computer Science at <a href='https://ucom.edu.py/' target='_blank' className='text-blue-500 underline'>Universidad Comunera</a>. <br />
            I work in a Mac-based environment and have experimented with various CSS libraries, including <span className='font-bold'>Tailwind, RadixUI, MaterialUI, and Bootstrap</span>, enhancing my skills in creating responsive and attractive UIs. <br />
            Also, I have tried <span className='font-bold'>Firebase</span> and <span className='font-bold'>Supabase</span>.
            I have also developed skills in mobile app development using <span className='font-bold'>ExpoSDK</span> and have deployed applications to the App Store. <br />
            I am familiar with several project management methodologies, including Scrum.<br />
            My curiosity has led me to explore different frontend frameworks like <span className='font-bold'> Svelte, Vue, and Astro</span>, reflecting my willingness to learn and adapt to new technologies. <br />
            This openness to experimentation and learning underlines my approach to software development â€” always ready to embrace the right tool for
            any given challenge! ðŸš€
